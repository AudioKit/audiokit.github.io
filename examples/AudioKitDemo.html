<p>
There are only two packaged examples that come with AudioKit.  The first example is Hello World, which is great for getting you started with AudioKit.  The second example project is the AudioKitDemo and it actually shows off quite a few features of AudioKit that fall under three main categories: synthesis, processing, and analysis.  Each category is represented as one folder in the project and one tab bar item in the app.
</p>

<h2>Synthesis</h2>

<p>There are many different synthesis tools inside AudioKit, but for this example we are only highlighting two: FM Synthesis and Physical Modeling.  Depending on where you press the rectangular boxes you will hear different parameters sent to the instruments to play different sounds.  We may add more synthesis examples over time, but this is enough of a demo to get you started. </p>

<p>We create the instruments in 'viewDidLoad' and then attach a tap gesture recognizer to two custom views that takes the touch point and scales them to instrument properties:</p>

{% highlight objective-c %}
- (IBAction)tapTambourine:(UITapGestureRecognizer *)sender {

    CGPoint touchPoint = [sender locationInView:tambourineTouchView];
    float scaledX = touchPoint.x / tambourineTouchView.bounds.size.width;
    float scaledY = 1.0 - touchPoint.y / tambourineTouchView.bounds.size.height;

    float intensity = scaledY*4000 + 20;
    float dampingFactor = scaledX / 2.0;
    TambourineNote *note = [[TambourineNote alloc] initWithIntensity:intensity
                                                       dampingFactor:dampingFactor];
    [tambourine playNote:note];
}
{% endhighlight %}


<h2>Processing</h2>

<p>The processing part of the app plays an audio loop and allows the user to alter the direction, speed, and pitch of the playback.  Then the output is convolved with two different impulse response files which can be mixed.</p>

<p>The properties are attached to sliders through the use of "AKPropertySlider".  In interface builder, change the class of the sliders to be an AKPropertySlider, then in the code, associate an instrument property with each slider:</p>

{% highlight objective-c %}
speedSlider.property    = audioFilePlayer.speed;
pitchSlider.property    = audioFilePlayer.scaling;
dishWellSlider.property = convolver.dishWellBalance;
dryWetSlider.property   = convolver.dryWetBalance;
{% endhighlight %}

<p>All properties will scale appropriately.  The only custom code that is needed is to automatically scale the pitch with the speed.</p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>The analysis portion processes the microphone input to determine the frequency and amplitude of the incoming sound.  The frequency is then compared to a list of known frequencies to display the musical notation of the sound's pitch.</p>

<p>This tab also highlights the various plots available in AudioKit, and on the storyboard you can find input waveform plots, FFT, frequency, amplitude, etc.  The parameters of these plots can be designated within the identity inspector.</p>



<h2>Mac OSX Version</h2>

<p>The OSX version of the AudioKitDemo works identically to the iOS version, and in fact uses the same instrument definition files.  The only difference is the user interface, since OSX uses AppKit rather than UIKit.</p>
