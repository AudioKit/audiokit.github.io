We’re really excited that you want to contribute to AudioKit! To help you get started, we’ve made this …

<p>
First, you're going to want to fork a copy of the AudioKit repository to your own GitHub account. To do this, click on the “Fork” button in the top right corner of the repository page.

<p>
Next, you need to clone your forked repository to your computer. You can do this either though the terminal, or through a Git front-end, such as SourceTree. The screenshots below are from SourceTree.
</p>

<p>
To add specific features, make a branch off your repository to test your ideas. Make sure you name your branch something descriptive so you can keep track of your work; this is especially important if you are working with multiple branches at once.

After you’ve finished working on your branch, commit and push your changes.

<p>
When your pull request has been approved, you'll see a notifcation in GitHub. At that point, change back to your main branch.

Then, delete the branch you were working on your changes in.

Finally, pull your changes from the develop branch. Make sure that you pull from “upstream”.
