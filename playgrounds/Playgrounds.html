<h3>Playgrounds will rock your world</h3>

<p>Playgrounds are a means to develop audio applications with immediate aural and visual feedback about what you are creating. Gone are the days of program-compile-listen-and-reprogram. Not only can you develop quickly, but you can stumble upon amazing sounds along the way. Truly, you're learning to play an instrument, and that instrument is AudioKit code. As you can tell, we're super excited about how this will help developers create amazing things.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>


<p>NO INSTALLATION REQUIRED.  These are simply Xcode playgrounds that are part of the AudioKit source project. But, you do need to download the source code as opposed to the precompiled framework and you need to build AudioKit.  All this is shown in the video below:</p>
