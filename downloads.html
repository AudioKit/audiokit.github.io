<p>
AudioKit is currently available for Mac OSX and iOS, however we are platform agnostic and support the porting of AudioKit's functionality to any language or device.  In fact, a browser-based version is in development and an Android version is currently being researched. Feel free to <a href="mailto:audiokit@hearforyourself.com">get in touch</a> if you would be interested in contributing!
</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>
We include a variety of sample projects alongside the toolkit so that you can get started right away.  Here's how to get the complete package.</p>

<h3>Installing using Git</h3>

<p>Installing from command line (defaults to "develop" branch):</p>

{% highlight bash %}
$ git clone git@github.com:audiokit/AudioKit.git
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Archives are available:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/audiokit/AudioKit/archive/master.zip">Master Branch (19.5MB zip)</a> - most stable </li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/audiokit/AudioKit/archive/develop.zip">Development Branch (19.5MB zip)</a> - latest and greatest </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Installing using CocoaPods</h3>

<p>In your project, update your Podfile:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
pod 'AudioKit', '~> 1.2'
{% endhighlight %}

Then execute:

{% highlight bash %}
$ pod install
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>Installing Xcode Documentation</h2>

<p>Code completion, pop-ups, and sidebar information are automatically created in Xcode, but if you would like Apple-style API reference documentation, download the docset:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/k357kav4xxf1072/io.audiokit.AudioKit.docset.tar.gz?dl=0"><p>
<img src=/images/docset.png style="width:100%; max-width:267px">
</p></a></p>

<p>
Un-tar it and place it in the Shared Documentation folder:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
tar -xf ~/Downloads/io.audiokit.AudioKit.docset.tar.gz -C ~/Library/Developer/Shared/Documentation/DocSets/
{% endhighlight %}
