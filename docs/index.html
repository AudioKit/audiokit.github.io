Hierarchically, the structure of an Audio Kit program usually looks like this:

<ul>
  <li><a href="/core-classes/">Manager</a> - which manages the sound engine and the creation of the...</li>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/core-classes/">Orchestra</a> - which is a collection of...</li>

        <ul>
          <li><a href="/parameters/">Parameters</a> - which can be audio streams, control signals, or constants</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>

Instruments can also create notes which are controllable objects in their own right, following this flow:

<ul>
  <li><a href="/core-classes/">Instruments</a> can spawn instances of...
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/core-classes/">Notes</a> - each of which can have their own independent...
    <ul>
        <li><a href="/properties/">Properties</a> - which define duration and local variations to the instrument's operations.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
