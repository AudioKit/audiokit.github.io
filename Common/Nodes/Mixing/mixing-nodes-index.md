## Balancer

This operation outputs a version of the audio source, amplitude-modified so that its rms power is equal to that of the comparator audio source. Thus a signal that has suffered loss of power (eg., in passing through a filter bank) can be restored by matching it with, for instance, its own source. It should be noted that this modifies amplitude only; output signal is not altered in any other respect.
