# Overview

## AKAmplitude Tracker

Performs a "root-mean-square" on a signal to get overall amplitude of a signal. The output signal looks similar to that of a classic VU meter.

RMS (Root-Mean-Square): A value that is the effective value of the total waveform.  It is really the area under the curve. In audio it is the continuous or music power that the amplifier can deliver.

## AKFrequency Tracker

This is based on an algorithm originally created by Miller Puckette.
