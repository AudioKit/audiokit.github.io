<h2>Walk-through</h2>

<p>There is a certain amount of configuration that is required on OSX that is not required to build iOS apps.  The first step is the same: Drag the AudioKit folder into your project.  Since this is a Mac project, delete the iOS folder and depending on whether this will be a Swift project, delete that too. Your Libraries folder should now look like the one below:

<p>
Because this is an Objective-C project, you'll also need to delete the Swift folder. If you were making a Swift-based Mac project, you would need to keep that folder in place.
</p>
</p>

<p>Then on the Build Phases tab, click the "+" button on the upper left of the window</p>

</p>

<p>Choose the "New Copy Files Phase"</p>
<p>

</p>

<p>Click the "+" on the bottom left</p>
<p>
<img src=/tutorials/osx/macBuildPhases3.png style="width:100%; max-width:678px" alt="Mac Build Phases 3">
</p>

<p>Find the framework from the pull-down menu within Libraries/OSX/csound-OSX:</p>

</p>

<p>Change the Destination to "Frameworks" so that your Copy Files section now looks like this screenshot:</p>
<p>

</p>

<p>Next, add another build phase by clicking on the "+" in the upper left, but this time choose the "New Run Script Phase":</p>
<p>
<img src=/tutorials/osx/macBuildPhases6.png style="width:100%; max-width:677px" alt="Mac Build Phases 6">
</p>

<p>Change the Shell to <code>/bin/bash</code> and paste in this one-line shell script:</p>
{% highlight bash %}
install_name_tool -change CsoundLib64.framework/Versions/6.0/CsoundLib64 @executable_path/../Frameworks/CsoundLib64.framework/Versions/6.0/CsoundLib64 $TARGET_BUILD_DIR/$EXECUTABLE_PATH
{% endhighlight %}
<!-- <p>So that your run script phase looks like:</p>
<p>
<img src=macBuildPhases7.png style="width:100%; max-width:1119px">
</p> -->

<p>Congratulations, your application should now be set up to include everything it needs to run AudioKit.  You should now be able to follow the AudioKit tutorials for either Objective-C or Swift.</p>
