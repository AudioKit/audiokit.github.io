<p>
Making an Xcode project using Swift is just as straight-forward as making one in Objective-C. When you're presented with a screen that says "Choose options for your new project" select "Swift" from the drop-down menu.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Now we can import Audio Kit into our Swift project. Navigate to your AudioKit repository. Then, drag the folder that says “AudioKit” into your project.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
After you do this, you’ll see a screen that will ask you to choose some options for adding the files. If you're just experiementing with Audio Kit for now, you can leave "Copy items if needed" unchecked. If you're making an app that will be sold on the App Store, then you'll want to make sure "Copy items if needed" is checked.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Then, click Finish.
</p>


<p>Once you've imported Audio Kit, you'll be able to see it in the project navigator pane:</p>

</p>


<p>
The last thing we need to do is delete the libraries that we won't be using for this project. Open up the AudioKit folder, you'll see a folder that says "Libraries" as shown below.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Since we're making an iOS project that uses Swift, we need to delete the OSX folder. Make sure you click "Delete references", and not "Delete items". When you're finished, your library folder will look like the one shown below:
</p>

<p>

</p>


<p>
There's one additional step we need to make in order to use Audio Kit in our Swift project. One of the great things about Swift is that we're abile to easily use Objective-C code in Swift projects. In order for Audio Kit to be exposed to our Swift project, we need to make a Bridging-Header file.
</p>

<p>
Make a new file (command-N), and select "Header File". Name the file "SwiftProject-Bridging-Header.h"Make sure you have "SwiftProject" selected under Targets.

<p>
<img src=/images/bridgingHeader.png>
</p>

<p>There's some default text in the bridging header file (shown below) that you can go ahead and delete that.</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
#ifndef SwiftProject_SwiftProject_Bridging_Header_h
#define SwiftProject_SwiftProject_Bridging_Header_h

#endif
{% endhighlight %}


<p>
Then, add the following import statements to the bridging header. These will allow our project to access all of the features of AKFoundation and AKTools.
</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
#import "AKFoundation.h"
#import "AKTools.h"
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Next, go to your target's build settings. Click on "SwiftProject" under "Targets".</p>

<p>
<img src=/images/swiftProjectTarget.png>
</p>

<p>Navigate to the build settings</p>

<p>
<img src=/images/buildSettings.png>
</p>

<p>Search for "briding header" in the search bar. You should see "Objective-C Bridging Header" underneath "Swift Compiler - Code Generation".

<p>
<img src=/images/objectivecBridgingHeader.png>
</p>

<p>Double click on the that line. A white box will pop up that will let you enter in some text. Add "SwiftProject-BridgingHeader.h".
</p>

<p>
<img src=/images/addingBridgingHeader.png>
</p>

<p>
Hit Enter, and your screen should look like the one below.

<p>

</p>

<p>
Now that our Swift project is able to "see" AudioKit, we can go ahead and start making our first instrument in Swift!"
