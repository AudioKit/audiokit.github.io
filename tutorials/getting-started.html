Setting up a project with Audio Kit is extremely easy. After you’ve created a new project in Xcode, navigate to your AudioKit repository. Then, drag the folder that says “AudioKit” (highlighted below) into your project.

After you do this, you’ll see a screen that will ask you to choose some options for adding the files.

Then, click Finish.
