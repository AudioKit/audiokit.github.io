<p>The McDonaldâ€™s placemat: just a paper placemat that turns into a full music production station! McTrax. By the use of conductive ink on a piece of paper you can connect your smartphone to our placemat via Bluetooth.</p>

<p>Powered by AudioKit, utilizing AudioKit's record, sequencing, and effect processing capabilities, Koert Gaaikema and his team mates were able to create this wonderfully
innovative audio application. Congrats everyone!</p>
