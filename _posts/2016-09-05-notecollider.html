<p>
Tap the screen to add the selected note shape. Use the music note button to change note shapes, use the Fx button to add Fx shapes. 
</p>
<p>
Fx shapes need to hit the same type of note shape three times in a row to add the effect to that note shape.
</p>
<p>
Shake your device to cause commotion.
</p>
<p>
Use the other controls to make the sounds more or less pleasant (tonality), or to increase physical chaos (weight).
