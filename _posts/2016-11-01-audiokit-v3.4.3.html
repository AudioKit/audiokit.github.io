<p>At the start of AudioKit 3.4 I announced that we'd be publicly sharing <a href="http://github.com/audiokit/AudioKit/projects">our goals and projects</a> and AudioKit 3.4.3 is our initial version of Audiobus and Inter-App Audio support.</p>

<p>Thanks to great help from Daniel Clelland and Audiobus's own Michael Tyson (or The Amazing Michael Tyson as I like to call him), it was pretty easy to get Audiobus working!</p>

<p>We also have written a two example apps that use Audiobus and a <a href="/audiobus/">tutorial</a> on how these apps were built which can serve as a template for your own Audiobus / Inter-App Audio apps.</p>

<p>This release also includes changes for Swift 3.0.1 and Xcode 8.1.</p>
