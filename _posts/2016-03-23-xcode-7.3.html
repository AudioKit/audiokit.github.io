<p>
With Xcode 7.3, AudioKit playgrounds are a lot more powerful and fun with interactive timeline features.  Since Xcode 7.3 was just released today, we're spending a few days making some updates and preparing a release, but if you want the new playgrounds now, just use the "develop" branch from Github!  Stay tuned for the full release to the master later this week.
