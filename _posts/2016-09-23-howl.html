<p>Daniel Clelland just released version 2.0 of his really beautiful AudioKit app "HOWL: A Formant Synthesizer". It now is built for iPad and iPhone and has AudioBus support!  Daniel describes it as follows:</p>
<blockquote>HOWL is a simple vocoder/synthesizer for iOS. It uses formants to simulate the human voice and a pitch-space keyboard to help you find interesting melodies. But mostly it just makes synthetic grunting noises.</blockquote>

<p>All we can add is that is has a wonderful UI and cool sounds!</p>

<p>Daniel is kind enough to provide his work not only as an app on the app store, but also as an open-source project on Github, plus he even has a nice web page for it:
