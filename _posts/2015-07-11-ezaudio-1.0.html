One of the packages AudioKit relies on for its graphing capabilities is Haris Ali's EZAudio, which has just released its 1.0 Version! Haris is a friend of AudioKit and we love EZAudio, in fact it inspired us to open-source AudioKit last year.  Now things have come full circle and AudioKit has helped to inspire Haris to make some fundamental improvements to EZAudio and release version 1.0.  We've incorporated the graphing improvements from EZAudio to AudioKit's develop branch, and soon we'll be merging all of our recent changes into the next release of AudioKit.
