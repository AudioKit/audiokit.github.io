title: Song Library Player is now the Effects Processor Demo

<p>I've recently moved the Song Library Player example out of the Examples directory in AudioKit and into its own repository on Github:</p>

<i><b>Update: This example now exists as part of the Examples repo here: <a href="https://github.com/audiokit/Examples">https://github.com/audiokit/Examples</a></b></i></p>

<p>Song Library Player was getting a bit too complex for a simple example folder project and we're going to make it even cooler and therefor a bit more complex.  The first change is that now instead of just having a reverb effect, there is also a Variable Delay and Moog Ladder filter.  These are chained effects so this project serves as a good example of chaining effects together.  We'll be adding more signal modifiers to the example so it will be a way to pull up an effect and hear what it does to songs from your library.</p>
