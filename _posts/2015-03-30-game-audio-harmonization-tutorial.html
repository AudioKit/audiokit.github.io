Alexander Hodge just published his <a href="https://github.com/ahodge/Game-Audio-Harmonization-Tutorial">Game Audio Harmonization Tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>This tutorial will guide you through the process of using AudioKit within a Unity iOS project to create procedural sound effects that are harmonized with the game music. The tutorial expects a basic level of familiarity with Unity and its game development environment, as well as Apple's Xcode IDE and Objective-C. The tutorial uses Unity 5.0.0.f4, available at <a href="http://www.unity3d.com">http://www.unity3d.com</a>, Xcode 6.2 available at <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/">https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/</a>), and AudioKit 2.0 available at <a href="http://www.audiokit.io">http://www.audiokit.io</a>. AudioKit is an open source iOS library for audio synthesis, processing, and analysis. The tutorial also uses Veemix, an integrated game music platform (<a href="https://www.veemix.com">https://www.veemix.com</a>) and EchoNest (<a href="http://www.echonest.com">http://www.echonest.com</a>) for music information retrieval. </p>
