Simple, intuitive, playful, powerful and innovator… We present to you fonofone, an application for musical creation education developed for the school environment by renowned composers and pedagogues. Adaptable to any grade from preschool to high school, fonofone allows a global path through the basic techniques of composition, from generating sounds to constructing the layout of a collective project and its interpretation.
<p>
Fonofone is a production of COSIMU, a non-profit based in Montreal,Canada. Our mission is to develop the youth’s sense of wonder, curiosity and imaginary, by conceiving innovative approaches as well as intuitive and innovative tools for creation. The application was designed by the composer and pedagogue Yves Daoust, in collaboration with the digital instrument-maker and artist Alexandre Burton.
