NAMM 2017 is over and once again it was a whirlwind!  This year we had 5 core team members, Stephane, Aure, Paul, Adam, and Jeff (in order from left to right).  It was great to collaborate in person for a change!

We have a lot of great apps coming out this year, so hopefully next year's NAMM we'll be demoing our apps instead of hacking on them!
