From Professor Martin Jaroszewicz at UCI: COSMOS:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>COSMOS is over and groups worked in very ambitious projects using SceneKit, SpriteKit and physics.  Most groups used Audiokit and particularly the Bubble Beats group used several filters and one of the instruments to model the sounds of popping bubble wrap. Other groups modeled in Chuck and then used Audiokit to playback the files at different rates.</p>

<p>Here is a link to the description of their projects.</p>
