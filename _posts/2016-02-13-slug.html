<h3>Talk #1: Fast & Fun Audio in Swift, with Aurelius Prochazka</h3>

<p>Even though iOS and OSX are rich multi-media environments, app sound is often overlooked and true innovation in audio technology has lagged behind. This talk will show how easy it is to develop audio expertise using Swift playgrounds to learn about audio synthesis, processing, and analysis with real time audio feedback. We'll move onto a discussion of how to use audio in apps, from traditional synthesizer emulations and sound-enhanced apps to more innovative applications. We'll end with a dive deep into the digital signal processing internals of AudioKit's audio units. </p>

<h3>Talk #2: Conquering Your Fear of Adopting Swift, with Brennan Stehling </h3>

<p>There's a mountain of Objective-C code already in place and it took years of development to get to this point. How do you convince your team that moving to Swift is worth the cost of rewriting all of it? What if you could replace one piece at a time and have a small team create frameworks with Swift which could be used by the rest of the app built in Objective-C? What does it take to build a framework? How is a project in Xcode configured to build everything together? How can a framework be developed and tested independently? </p>

<p>Over the course of a few years a large code base could be migrated to use Swift as modules and allow the team to gradually learn the new language and benefit from the new language features. It is also possible to move Objective-C code to frameworks to use with a new app built in Swift which leverages the existing Objective-C codebase. And these steps are not as difficult or time consuming as you might imagine.</p>

<p>This talk will introduce the steps to define a portion of functionality which could be built out as an isolated module and made interoperable with the Objective-C codebase.
