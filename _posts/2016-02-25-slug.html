<h3>Fast & Fun Audio in Swift, with Aurelius Prochazka</h3>

<p>Even though iOS and OSX are rich multi-media environments, app sound is often overlooked and true innovation in audio technology has lagged behind. This talk will show how easy it is to develop audio expertise using Swift playgrounds to learn about audio synthesis, processing, and analysis with real time audio feedback. We'll move onto a discussion of how to use audio in apps, from traditional synthesizer emulations and sound-enhanced apps to more innovative applications. We'll end with a dive deep into the digital signal processing internals of AudioKit's audio units. </p>
