<p>Laurent Gaidon released "Clay", an AudioKit-powered music app!</p>

<p>Check out the amazing web site he built for the app at <a href="http://www.claymusic.fr/">claymusic.fr</a>.</p>

<p>With simple gestures, play music in the air. Clay is a hand-controlled music player - launch the app, choose songs you love and conduct with your hands free.</p>

<p>Be a DJ or a conductor, adapt your environment to the type of music you listen to and discover the sensations of touchless playing and mixing.</p>
<p>Clay turns your iOS device into a motion sensor. Modulate and mix your favorite songs without touching your iPhone. Create Claylists and shape sounds in the air.</p>
<p>Every move triggers a sound variation (reverb, freeze, volume, etc.) and graphic effects (smoke, ice, fire, explosion, etc.).<!--  -->
<p>For optimal use, avoid variations of lights and shadows on the camera. If the iOS device moves during a game phase, re-calibrate by double-clicking on the screen.</p>
