<p>AudioKit Version 3.5 is out and its mostly a general clean up and improvement, with the major feature is full Audiobus capabalities including presets.  We also have very <a href=/audiobus/>complete documentation and walkthroughs of creating Audiobus enabled application with AudioKit</a></p>

<p>We wanted to have a round-number release to coincide with Michael Tyson's recent decision to retire "The Amazing Audio Engine" and forward his potential new users to AudioKit.</p>

<p>I've always personally admired Michael Tyson and not only his audio engine, but also Loopy and Audiobus.  Audiobus is the single most important application I have on my iPad.  Everyone should get it.  It's way better than Inter-App Audio alone, and it's under active development and just getting better and better.</p>

<p>So, if you're new to AudioKit and coming from The Amazing Audio Engine, please let me welcome you.  Come join our <a href=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/audiokit>forum</a>, and if you're an active developer with chops, let us know and we'll consider you for the smaller AudioKit slack group.</p>
