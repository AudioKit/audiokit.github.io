Michael Tyson of The Amazing Audio Engine wrote an excellent article on his A Tasty Pixel blog:  <a href="http://atastypixel.com/blog/four-common-mistakes-in-audio-development/">Four common mistakes in audio development</a> that should be required reading for Audio programmers.  I won't go into much detail since you should already be at his site instead of this one.  But, in case you are still here, I'll also point you to his <a href="https://github.com/TheAmazingAudioEngine/RealtimeWatchdog">Realtime Watchdog</a> tool that he used to profile various audio libraries and you should use to check your apps as well.</p>

<p>The Amazing Audio Engine, and therefore Michael Tyson, are heroes in the audio community and an inspiration to us all, even if our libraries differ in purpose and execution.</p>
