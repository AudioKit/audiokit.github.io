<p>
We're very proud to announce the release of AudioKit Version 2.0.  </p>

<p>The most exciting part of this release is that we now have Playgrounds.  AudioKit Playgrounds are super powerful environments for audio development in real time, and will change the way you program audio.  You can hear and see nearly instant feedback while you're developing instruments and creating audio landscapes.  There are a number of real time graphing options available to you during this process as well, so you engage your eyes and your ears together.  
</p>

<p>We want to encourage everyone to get involved and write Playgrounds for whatever genre of audio programming you have proficiency in.  We look forward to future Playgrounds for topics such as spectral processing, granular synthesis, and more.  
</p>

<p>There are a ton of other updates too, include a much better syntax in which you don't have to do "connect" instruments anymore.  AKTable is now a first-class citizen, and you can do very complex table math and generation directly.  
</p>

<p>Thanks everyone, none of this would have happened without all you early adopters and people making cool new AudioKit projects.  
</p>

<p>Thanks again!  We look forward to hearing what you make next.
