Created by Vlad Semkin, ZERO to Z is an abstract minimalist meditation game where you grow connections to make progress. 
Designed as peaceful & constructive, game mechanics are novel & inspired by algorithms found in nature (namely DLA), 
putting a spin on the casual puzzle/arcade genre.
<p>
Vlad got his intro to coding using Processing and learnt both about diffusion-limited aggregation and similar algorithms 
  as well as physics simulation through Daniel Shiffman’s “Nature of Code”. The game uses natural growth phenomena as a 
  game mechanic, invited the player to reach end points by accumulating/growing genes. To reach the end point, you are 
  required the balance stress put on the stem as well as environmental phenomena affecting the growing stems. The first 
  few levels seem easy but after level 12 or so, things can quite difficult since you need to find ways to build your 
  stem while at the same time avoiding the points on the screen that cause them to die.

The game is available on the Apple AppStore for 0.99$. Created using AudioKit! No in-app purchase and no notifications.
