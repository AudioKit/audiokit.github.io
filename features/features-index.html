<h3>We Love AudioKit and You Might Too!</h3>
<p>Make no mistake about it, we built AudioKit out of a deep love for sound and music, and huge amount of respect for people who make amazing audio apps.  Our passion for creating the best possible environment for creating audio apps has led us to build a toolkit that excels on numerous fronts, each of which are discussed in more-depth from the links on the left. To boil it down to a few points, AudioKit was built to be:</p>

<p><ul class="iconlist">
    <li><i class="icon-line-play"></i>Easy-to-learn and understand</li>
    <li><i class="icon-line-play"></i>The quickest way to develop a real-world audio application</li>
    <li><i class="icon-line-play"></i>Powerful enough to enable your most ambitious ideas</li>
    <li><i class="icon-line-play"></i>Evolving and improving over time</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>AudioKit 3 Features</h3>

<table class="table table-bordered table-hover">

<thead><tr class="success"><th>Feature</th><th>V3</th></tr></thead>

<tr>
<th class="success">Live Coding with Playgrounds</th>
<td>
    <p>AudioKit 3.0 brings audio development and experimentation to Xcode's native Swift Playgrounds. AudioKit Playgrounds allow for rapid prototyping of an audio system, with instant feedback of how your code sounds. You no longer have to recompile your project after changing a single parameter to hear what the new value sounds like-just make your changes, and the Playground will already have updated itself. Once you've written and tested your audio system using Playgrounds, you can use that code in your main app.</p>

    <p>There are over 100 playgrounds included with AudioKit!  The playgrounds come in two flavors, iOS, and OSX, because the playgrounds for each OS have slightly different capabilities. </p>

</tr>

<tr>
<th class="success">Installation</th>
<td><p>Extremely easy installation as a framework.  Basically just drag the framework into your project.  CocoaPods and Carthage are also both supported.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th class="success">Examples</th>
<td><p>11 iOS Examples, 4 macOS examples, and 1 lonely tvOS example.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th class="success">Audio Engine</th>
<td>
<p>CoreAudio, AVAudioEngine, Synthesis Toolkit (STK) and Soundpipe/Sporth which includes code from Chuck, Csound, Faust, Guitarix, ToneStack.  Basically, if is open-sourced we can include it.  Email us!</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th class="success"><nobr>Integration w/ Audio Tools</nobr></th>
<td>
<p>AudioKit 3 attempts to be a cooperative member of any audio ecosystem.  AudioKit's nodes are just Audio Units themselves, so they can be dropped in to a signal chain as you wish.  Any third party tool can be easily included in the signal chain as well.
</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th class="success">Sequencing</th>
<td><p>Sequencing is achieved through Apple's CoreAudio sequencers, so it is quite powerful.  There are few sequencing playrounds and examples included to get you up to speed.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th class="success">Testing</th>
<td><p>AudioKit has both unit tests and continuous integration testing, described on the <a href="/tests/">Tests</a> page.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th class="success"><nobr>Docs and Tutorials</nobr></th>
<td><p>Gorgeous docs generated by Jazzy.  Playgrounds do a great job of replacing tutorials.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th class="success">Graphing</th>
<td>
<p>Plots of audio at any point in the signal chain.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th class="success">Language</th>
<td>
<p>Written in Swift with C/C++ underpinnings.  The framewowrk probably works fine with Objective-C projects, but we're focussing on Swift from now on, because it rocks!</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th class="success">License</th>
<td><p>MIT License</p></td>

<h3>Features where AudioKit 2 still wins (but we're working on them)</h3>

<table class="table table-bordered table-hover">

<thead><tr class="danger"><th>Feature</th><th>V2.x</th><th>V3</th></tr></thead>

<tr>
<th class="danger"><nobr>Sensible Defaults and Presets</nobr></th>
<td><p>Yes.</p></td>
<td><p>Defaults, yes.  Presets not so much.  But they are not off the radar and they will be added.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th class="danger">Templates</th>
<td><p>Xcode templates for common classes.</p></td>
<td><p>No templates yet.  While we're able to make templates, they are not too high on our priority list because AudioKit 3 is so flexible, you're much more free to code in your own style.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th class="danger">Tests</th>
<td><p>Extremely well tested.</p></td>
<td><p> Travis CI is implemented to ensure the frameworks compile and the projects can be built.  Test infrastructure has been started, with a handful of test written, but not yet automated.  This is still very important to us and it is a high priority. </p></td>
