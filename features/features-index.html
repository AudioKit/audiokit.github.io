<h3>Features where AudioKit 2 still wins (but we're working on them)</h3>

<table class="table table-bordered table-hover">

<thead><tr class="danger"><th>Feature</th><th>V2.x</th><th>V3</th></tr></thead>

<tr>
<th class="danger"><nobr>Sensible Defaults and Presets</nobr></th>
<td><p>Yes.</p></td>
<td><p>Defaults, yes.  Presets not so much.  But they are not off the radar and they will be added.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th class="danger">Templates</th>
<td><p>Xcode templates for common classes.</p></td>
<td><p>No templates yet.  While we're able to make templates, they are not too high on our priority list because AudioKit is so flexible, you're much more free to code in your own style.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th class="danger">Tests</th>
<td><p>Extremely well tested.</p></td>
<td><p> Travis CI is implemented to ensure the frameworks compile and the projects can be built.  Test infrastructure has been started, with a handful of test written, but not yet automated.  This is still very important to us and it is a high priority. </p></td>
</tr>
