<h3>We Love AudioKit and You Might Too!</h3>
<p>Make no mistake about it, we built AudioKit out of a deep love for sound and music, and huge amount of respect for people who make amazing audio apps.  Our passion for creating the best possible environment for creating audio apps has led us to build a toolkit that excels on numerous fronts, each of which are discussed in more-depth from the links on the left. To boil it down to a few points, AudioKit was built to be:</p>

<p><ul class="iconlist">
    <li><i class="icon-line-play"></i>Easy-to-learn and understand</li>
    <li><i class="icon-line-play"></i>The quickest way to develop a real-world audio application</li>
    <li><i class="icon-line-play"></i>Powerful enough to enable your most ambitious ideas</li>
    <li><i class="icon-line-play"></i>Evolving and improving over time</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>Those goals are what have driven us to create a new version of AudioKit, version 3, which is a complete rewrite of AudioKit.  The remainder of this page is dedicated to discussing how the features have changed from AudioKit 2 to 3.</p>


<h3>Features where AudioKit 3 Crushes AudioKit 2</h3>

<table class="table table-bordered table-hover">

<thead><tr class="success"><th>Feature</th><th>V2.x</th><th>V3 Beta</th></tr></thead>

<tr>
<th class="success">Live Coding with Playgrounds</th>
<td>
    <p>35 Objective-C Playgrounds based off of KZPlayground are powerful but do require extending Xcode with dynamic code injection and broke every time you updated Xcode.
    </p>
</td>
<td>
    <p>AudioKit 3.0 brings audio development and experimentation to Xcode's native Swift Playgrounds. AudioKit Playgrounds allow for rapid prototyping of an audio system, with instant feedback of how your code sounds. You no longer have to recompile your project after changing a single parameter to hear what the new value sounds like-just make your changes, and the Playground will already have updated itself. Once you've written and tested your audio system using Playgrounds, you can use that code in your main app.</p>

    <p>There are over 100 playgrounds included with AudioKit!  The playgrounds come in two flavors, iOS, and OSX, because the playgrounds for each OS have different capabilities.  OS X Playgrounds have the ability to spawn windows with sliders for instance.  On the other hand, many processing and generation nodes don't work in OS X, so there is a trade-off.</p>

<tr>
<th class="success">Installation</th>
<td>
<p class="success">Fairly easy installation as a static or dynamic library.</p>
</td>
<td><p>Extremely easy installation as a framework.  Basically just drag the framework into your project.  CocoaPods and Carthage support is planned and may be in place by the time you're reading this.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th class="success">Examples</th>
<td><p>Hello World and AudioKitDemo.</p></td>
<td><p>Hello World plus Analog Synth X, a virtual analog synthesizer that is so cool we submitted it to the AppStore (as a free app of course!).  AudioKit Particles and a few MIDI Sequencing demos are included as well.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th class="success">Audio Engine</th>
<td>
<p>Csound</p></td>
<td>
<p>CoreAudio, AVAudioEngine and Soundpipe/Sporth which includes code from Chuck, Csound, Faust, Guitarix, ToneStack.  Basically, if is open-sourced we can include it.  Email us!</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th class="success"><nobr>Integration w/ Audio Tools</nobr></th>
<td><p>Not so much.</p></td>
<td>
<p>AudioKit 3 attempts to be a cooperative member of any audio ecosystem.  AudioKit's nodes are just Audio Units themselves, so they can be dropped in to a signal chain as you wish.  Any third party tool can be easily included in the signal chain as well.
</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th class="success">Sequencing</th>
<td><p>Powerful but the timing was imprecise.</p></td>
<td><p>Sequencing is achieved through Apple's CoreAudio sequencers, so it is quite powerful.  There are few sequencing playrounds and examples included to get you up to speed.</p></td>
</tr>

<h3>Features where AudioKit 3 has a slight edge over AudioKit 2</h3>

<table class="table table-bordered table-hover">

<thead><tr class="success"><th>Feature</th><th>V2.x</th><th>V3 Beta</th></tr></thead>

<tr>
<th class="success"><nobr>Docs and Tutorials</nobr></th>
<td><p>Gorgeous docs generated by AppleDoc. Good tutorials.</p></td>
<td><p>Gorgeous docs generated by Jazzy.  Playgrounds do a great job of replacing tutorials.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th class="success">Graphing</th>
<td>
<p>Plots of audio at input or output.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Plots of audio at any point in the signal chain.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th class="success">Language</th>
<td><p>Written in Objective-C, accessible from Swift apps.</p></td>
<td>
<p>Written in Swift with C/C++ underpinnings.  The framewowrk probably works fine with Objective-C projects, but we're focussing on Swift from now on, because it rocks!</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th class="success">License</th>
<td><p>MIT License with an asterisk.</p></td>
<td><p>MIT License. <b>Period.</b></p></td>

<h3>Features where AudioKit 2 still wins (but we're working on them)</h3>

<table class="table table-bordered table-hover">

<thead><tr class="danger"><th>Feature</th><th>V2.x</th><th>V3 Beta</th></tr></thead>

<tr>
<th class="danger"><nobr>Sensible Defaults and Presets</nobr></th>
<td><p>Yes.</p></td>
<td><p>Defaults, yes.  Presets not so much.  But they are not off the radar and they will be added.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th class="danger">Stability</th>
<td><p>This code has been stable for a while and is powering apps in the Apple Store.</p></td>
<td><p>Well, AudioKit 3 still in Beta and is a complete rewrite of AudioKit, so we can't say for sure, but it's been working great for us so far.</p></td>
</tr>


<tr>
<th class="danger">Templates</th>
<td><p>Xcode templates for common classes.</p></td>
<td><p>No templates yet.  While we're able to make templates, they are not too high on our priority list because AudioKit 3 is so flexible, you're much more free to code in your own style.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th class="danger">Tests</th>
<td><p>Extremely well tested.</p></td>
<td><p>Test infrastructure has been started, but no tests have been written yet.  This is still very important to us and it is a high priority.   Travis CI is implemented to ensure the frameworks compile and the projects can be built.</p></td>
</tr>
