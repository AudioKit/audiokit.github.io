<h3>Features where AudioKit 2 still wins (but we're working on them)</h3>

<table class="table table-bordered table-hover">

<thead><tr class="danger"><th>Feature</th><th>V2.x</th><th>V3</th></tr></thead>

<tr>
<th class="danger"><nobr>Sensible Defaults and Presets</nobr></th>
<td><p>Yes.</p></td>
<td><p>Defaults, yes.  Presets not so much.  But they are not off the radar and they will be added.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th class="danger">Templates</th>
<td><p>Xcode templates for common classes.</p></td>
<td><p>No templates yet.  While we're able to make templates, they are not too high on our priority list because AudioKit 3 is so flexible, you're much more free to code in your own style.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th class="danger">Tests</th>
<td><p>Extremely well tested.</p></td>
<td><p> Travis CI is implemented to ensure the frameworks compile and the projects can be built.  Test infrastructure has been started, with a handful of test written, but not yet automated.  This is still very important to us and it is a high priority. </p></td>
</tr>
