<h2>GitHub Repository</h2>

<p>There are two branches of AudioKit, the Master branch, and the Develop branch. The Develop branch is the default branch as it is where new features of AudioKit are added as they are finished... the very latest and greatest. If you're not comfortable living on the edge, then the Master branch is the most 'stable' option, as it is only changed when a new version of AudioKit is released. </p>

<p>Installing from command line (defaults to "master" branch):</p>

{% highlight bash %}
$ git clone https://github.com/audiokit/AudioKit.git
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Please note that you can not upgrade from to AudioKit 3 from previous versions, you need to reclone the repository. </p>

<h3>Installation Instructions</h3>
<p>
Since version 3.0, AudioKit is distributed as a universal dynamic framework with no further dependencies on all supported platforms. This makes it easy to integrate within your own projects.

The installation instructions below cover both installing the compiled framework or compiling the framework from source:</p>

</ul>

<h3>Installing using CocoaPods</h3>

<p>You can use CocoaPods to install AudioKit. In your project, update your Podfile:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
pod 'AudioKit', '~> 3.0'
{% endhighlight %}

Then execute:

{% highlight bash %}
$ pod install
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>Installing Xcode Documentation</h2>

<p>Code completion, pop-ups, and sidebar information are automatically created in Xcode, but if you would like Apple-style API reference documentation, download the <a href="/docs/docsets/AudioKit.tgz">docset</a>.</p>

<p>Un-tar it and place it in the Shared Documentation folder:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
tar -xf ~/Downloads/AudioKit.tgz -C ~/Library/Developer/Shared/Documentation/DocSets/
{% endhighlight %}
