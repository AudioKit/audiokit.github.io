<h4>You don't need to understand anything on this page,
</h4><h4>all you need to do is hear a one second long beep.
</h4><h4>If you hear that, then everything worked and you can move on.
</h4><h4>Sure, you can change the parameters on this page to hear different beeps,
</h4><h4>but trust us, things are about to sound a lot cooler than just beeps!
