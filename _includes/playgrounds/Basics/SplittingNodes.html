<p><h3>Splitting Nodes
</h3> All nodes in AudioKit can have multiple destinations, the only
 caveat is that all of the destinations do have to eventually be mixed
 back together and none of the parallel signal paths can have any time stretching.</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
import AudioKit

{% endhighlight %}
<p>Prepare the source audio player</p>

{% highlight ruby %}let file = try AKAudioFile(readFileName: "drumloop.wav", baseDir: .resources)

let player = try AKAudioPlayer(file: file)
player.looping = true

{% endhighlight %}
<p>The following nodes are both acting on the original player node</p>

{% highlight ruby %}var ringMod = AKRingModulator(player)

var delay = AKDelay(player)
delay.time = 0.01
delay.feedback = 0.8
delay.dryWetMix = 1

{% endhighlight %}
<p>Any number of inputs can be equally summed into one output, including the
 original player, allowing us to create dry/wet mixes even for effects that
 don&#39;t have that property by default</p>

{% highlight ruby %}let mixer = AKMixer(player, delay)

AudioKit.output = mixer
AudioKit.start()
player.play()
