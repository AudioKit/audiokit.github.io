<p><h3>Non-Audio Tutorial
</h3> In the AudioKit Playgrounds, you&#39;ll learn a lot about processing audio,
 but we won&#39;t explain most other basic programming concepts that we&#39;ll use.
 So, here&#39;s a mini-tutorial of things that you should probably understand going forward.</p>

<p>You will always see the <code>import</code> lines which bring in all of
 AudioKit&#39;s functionality to the playground.</p>

{% highlight ruby %}import AudioKitPlaygrounds
import AudioKit

{% endhighlight %}
<p>If you intend to use some of the user interface elements provided by the optional AudioKitUI
 framework, you will also need to import it.</p>

{% highlight ruby %}import AudioKitUI

{% endhighlight %}
<p>ALERT: This is also the line that most commonly shows an error &quot;No such module&quot;
 This just means you haven&#39;t built AudioKitPlaygrounds yet, in which case pressing Cmd-B or
 accessing the &quot;Product&quot; menu and choosing &quot;Build&quot;.</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>To use a file, copy it intot playground&#39;s &quot;Resources&quot; folder and refer to it by name:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}let file = try AKAudioFile(readFileName: "mixloop.wav")

{% endhighlight %}
<p>You are not limited to using the sound files provided with AudioKit, in fact
 we encourage you to drag your own sound files to the Resources folder.
 Ideally, to keep things running quickly, loopable 10-20 second <code>.wav</code> or <code>.aiff</code>
 files are recommended.  Many free loops are avaiable online at sites such as
 <a href="http://www.looperman.com/">looperman.com</a> or <a href="http://www.freesound.org/">freesound.org</a>.</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>While we will do our best to annotate the playgrounds well, you can also get
 more information about the different code elements on the page by clicking
 on them and looking at the Quick Help Inspector.  Or, you can also option-click
 on any class, method, or variable name to show information about that element.
 Try it with the lines below:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}let player = AKPlayer(audioFile: file)
let effect = AKMoogLadder(player)

{% endhighlight %}
<p>The following lines keep a playground executing even after the last line is
 run so that the audio elements that were started have time to play and make
 sounds for us to listen to.</p>

{% highlight ruby %}import PlaygroundSupport
PlaygroundPage.current.needsIndefiniteExecution = true
{% endhighlight %}
<p>The other ways we&#39;ll keep playgrounds running will by using <code>sleep</code> and <code>usleep</code>
 functions and infinite while loops.</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>You can view the waveform on the timeline for any playground page by adding
 the following lines if they don&#39;t exist.  The plot does not usually appear
 by default because it takes significant power to draw the plots and we don&#39;t
 want your laptop&#39;s fan to fire up and drain your battery unnecessarily</p>

{% highlight ruby %}let plotView = AKOutputWaveformPlot.createView()
PlaygroundPage.current.liveView = plotView

{% endhighlight %}
<p>Now that we are near the bottom of the screen (unless you have a majorly tall monitor!)
 we&#39;d like to call your attention to the playground controls on the
 bottom left right below the navbar.</p>

<p>The first button toggles the console log which can be useful to look at when
 things go wrong. The second button is your play / stop button which is
 useful to control playback of the audio in the playground. If you click and
 hold on this button you will get a pop-up that will allow you choose between
 automatically running the playground or manually pressing play.  They both
 have their reason.  Automatic running is great for changing a parameter and
 quickly hearing the audio results.   Manual Run is better for when you&#39;re in
 the middle of creating an audio system and you don&#39;t want to hear results
 until you&#39;re further along in the process.</p>
