<h3>Playgrounds to Production
</h3>

<p>The intention of most of the AudioKit Playgrounds is to highlight a particular
 concept.  To keep things clear, we have kept the amount of code to a minimum.
 But the flipside of that decision is that code from playgrounds will look a little
 different from production.  In general, to see best practices, you can check out
 the AudioKit examples project, but here in this playground we&#39;ll highlight some
 important ways playground code differs from production code.</p>

<p>In production, you would only import AudioKit, not AudioKitPlaygrounds</p>

{% highlight ruby %}import AudioKitPlaygrounds
import AudioKit

{% endhighlight %}
<h4>Memory management
</h4>

<p>In a playground, you don&#39;t have to worry about whether a node is retained, so you can
 just write:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}let oscillator = AKOscillator()
AudioKit.output = oscillator
AudioKit.start()

{% endhighlight %}
<p>But if you did the same type of thing in a project:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}class BadAudioEngine {
    init() {
        let oscillator = AKOscillator()
        AudioKit.output = oscillator
        AudioKit.start()
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}
<p>It wouldn&#39;t work because the oscillator node would be lost right after the init
 method completed.  Instead,  makensure it is declared as an instance variable:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}class AudioEngine {
    var oscillator: AKOscillator
    
    init() {
        oscillator = AKOscillator()
        AudioKit.output = oscillator
        AudioKit.start()
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}
<h4>Error Handling
</h4>

<p>In AudioKit playgrounds, failable initializers are just one line:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}let file = try AKAudioFile()
var player = try AKAudioPlayer(file: file)

{% endhighlight %}
<p>In production code, this would need to be wrapped in a do-catch block</p>

{% highlight ruby %}do {
    let file = try AKAudioFile(readFileName: "drumloop.wav", baseDir: .resources)
    player = try AKAudioPlayer(file: file)
} catch {
    AKLog("File Not Found")
}

{% endhighlight %}
