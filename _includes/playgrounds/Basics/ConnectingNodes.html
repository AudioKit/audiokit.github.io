<p><h3>Connecting Nodes
</h3> Playing audio is great, but now let&#39;s process that audio.
 Now that you&#39;re up and running, let&#39;s take it a step further by
 loading up an audio file and processing it. We&#39;re going to do this
 by connecting nodes together. A node is simply an object that will
 take in audio input, process it, and pass the processed audio to
 another node, or to the Digital-Analog Converter (speaker).</p>

{% highlight ruby %}import PlaygroundSupport
import AudioKit

let file = try AKAudioFile(readFileName: "drumloop.wav", baseDir: .resources)

{% endhighlight %}
<p>Set up a player to the loop the file&#39;s playback</p>

{% highlight ruby %}var player = try AKAudioPlayer(file: file)
player.looping = true

{% endhighlight %}
<p>Next we&#39;ll connect the audio player to a delay effect</p>

{% highlight ruby %}var delay = AKDelay(player)

{% endhighlight %}
<p>Set the parameters of the delay here</p>

{% highlight ruby %}delay.time = 0.1 // seconds
delay.feedback  = 0.8 // Normalized Value 0 - 1
delay.dryWetMix = 0.2 // Normalized Value 0 - 1

{% endhighlight %}
<p>Continue adding more nodes as you wish, for example, reverb:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}let reverb = AKReverb(delay)
reverb.loadFactoryPreset(.cathedral)

AudioKit.output = reverb
AudioKit.start()

player.play()

PlaygroundPage.current.needsIndefiniteExecution = true
{% endhighlight %}
