<h3>Connecting Nodes Part 2
</h3>

<p>The intention of most of the AudioKit Playgrounds is to highlight a particular
 concept.  To keep things clear, we have kept the amount of code to a minimum.
 But the flipside of that decision is that code from playgrounds will look a little
 different from production.  In general, to see best practices, you can check out
 the AudioKit examples project, but here in this playground we&#39;re going to redo 
 the code from the &quot;Connecting Nodes&quot; playground in a way that is more like how 
 the code would appear in a project.</p>

{% highlight ruby %}import AudioKitPlaygrounds

<p>Here we begin the code how it would appear in a project</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
import AudioKit

// Create a class to handle the audio set up
class AudioEngine {

    // Declare your nodes as instance variables
    var player: AKAudioPlayer!
    var delay: AKDelay!
    var reverb: AKReverb!

    init() {
        // Set up a player to the loop the file's playback
        do {
            let file = try AKAudioFile(readFileName: "drumloop.wav")
            player = try AKAudioPlayer(file: file)
        } catch {
            AKLog("File Not Found")
            return
        }
        player.looping = true

        // Next we'll connect the audio player to a delay effect
        delay = AKDelay(player)

        // Set the parameters of the delay here
        delay.time = 0.1 // seconds
        delay.feedback = 0.8 // Normalized Value 0 - 1
        delay.dryWetMix = 0.2 // Normalized Value 0 - 1

        // Continue adding more nodes as you wish, for example, reverb:
        reverb = AKReverb(delay)
        reverb.loadFactoryPreset(.cathedral)

        AudioKit.output = reverb
        AudioKit.start()
    }
}

// Create your engine and start the player
let engine = AudioEngine()
engine.player.play()
