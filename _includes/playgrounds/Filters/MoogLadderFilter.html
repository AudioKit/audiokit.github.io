<p><h3>Moog Ladder Filter
</h3> One of the coolest filters available in AudioKit is the Moog Ladder.
 It&#39;s based off of Robert Moog&#39;s iconic ladder filter, which was the
 first implementation of a voltage - controlled filter used in an
 analog synthesizer. As such, it was the first filter that gave the
 ability to use voltage control to determine the cutoff frequency of the
 filter. As we&#39;re dealing with a software implementation, and not an
 analog synthesizer, we don&#39;t have to worry about dealing with
 voltage control directly. However, by using this node, you can
 emulate some of the sounds of classic analog synthesizers in your app.</p>
