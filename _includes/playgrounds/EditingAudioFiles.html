<p><h3>Editing Audio Files
</h3><h4>Let&#39;s have some fun with our drum loop
</h4></p>

{% highlight ruby %}
import XCPlayground
import AudioKit

{% endhighlight %}
<p>First we load the drumloop</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
let loop = try? AKAudioFile(readFileName: "drumloop.wav", baseDir: .Resources)

{% endhighlight %}
<p>You may have noticed that the drumloop doesn&#39;t loop so well. Let&#39;s fix this...</p>

{% highlight ruby %}let fixedLoop = try? loop!.extract(fromSample: 0, toSample: Int64(3.42 * 44100))

{% endhighlight %}
<p>Now out drumloop is one bar long and perfectly loops. Let&#39;s extract the kick,
 the snare and hihat into sixteenth note long files:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}let oneBarLength = fixedLoop!.samplesCount

let oneSixteenthLength = oneBarLength / 16

let kick = try?  fixedLoop!.extract(fromSample: 0, toSample: oneSixteenthLength)
let snare = try? fixedLoop!.extract(fromSample: oneSixteenthLength * 4,
                                    toSample: oneSixteenthLength * 5)
let hihat = try? fixedLoop!.extract(fromSample: oneSixteenthLength * 2,
                                    toSample: oneSixteenthLength * 3)

{% endhighlight %}
<p>Notice that we don&#39;t provide any name or location for those files (in fact, we don&#39;t care...)
 If no name / location are set, files will be created in temp directory with a unique name.
 But you could choose name and location if you wish. Let&#39;s check this:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
let kickFileName = kick!.fileNamePlusExtension
let kickFilePath = kick!.directoryPath

{% endhighlight %}
<p>I love hihat, so normalize our Hihat sample so it will be as loud as other instruments...</p>

{% highlight ruby %}let normalizedHihat = try? hihat!.normalize()

{% endhighlight %}
<p>Why not making some new files by reversing them</p>

{% highlight ruby %}let reverseKick = try? kick!.reverse()
let reverseSnare = try? snare!.reverse()
let reverseHihat = try? normalizedHihat!.reverse()

// A sixteenth note silence could be handy...
let silence = try?  AKAudioFile.silent(oneSixteenthLength)

{% endhighlight %}
<p>Now, we put all them in an array so we can later randomly pick samples.
 Some are doubled so they&#39;ll have more luck to be picked.</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
let samplesBox: [AKAudioFile] = [kick!, snare!, kick!, snare!, kick!, snare!,
                                 normalizedHihat!, reverseKick!, reverseSnare!, reverseHihat!,
                                 silence!, silence!, silence!, silence!, silence!]

{% endhighlight %}
<p>Now, we&#39;ll play the original loop three times,</p>

{% highlight ruby %}let threeTimesLoop =  try? fixedLoop!.append(fixedLoop!)
var sequence = try? threeTimesLoop!.append(fixedLoop!)
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Next, we append a random sequence of 16 sixteenth of audio to build our random drum solo...</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
for i in 0..<16 {
    let newSampleIndex = randomInt(0..<samplesBox.count)
    let newSound = samplesBox[newSampleIndex]
    print ("picked sample #\(newSampleIndex) name: \(newSound.fileNamePlusExtension)")
    var newFile = try? sequence!.append(newSound)
    sequence = newFile!
}

{% endhighlight %}
<p>Each time you&#39;ll run this playground, the resulting audioFile will be different.
 Let&#39;s listen to our edited audiofile: Original Loop 3 times,
 followed by the &quot;drum solo of the day&quot;...</p>

{% highlight ruby %}

let sequencePlayer = try? AKAudioPlayer(file: sequence!)
sequencePlayer!.looping = true

AudioKit.output = sequencePlayer!
AudioKit.start()
sequencePlayer!.play()
