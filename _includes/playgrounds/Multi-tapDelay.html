<p><h3>Multi-tap Delay
</h3><h4>A multi-tap delay is a delay line where multiple &#39;taps&#39; or outputs are
</h4><h4>taken from a delay buffer at different points, and the taps are then
</h4><h4>summed with the original. Multi-tap delays are great for creating
</h4><h4>rhythmic delay patterns, but they can also be used to create sound
</h4><h4>fields of such density that they start to take on some of the qualities
</h4><h4>we&#39;d more usually associate with reverb. - Geoff Smith, Sound on Sound

<p>In AudioKit, you can create a multitap easily through creating a function
 that mixes together several delays and gains.</p>

{% highlight ruby %}func multitapDelay(input: AKNode, times: [Double], gains: [Double]) -> AKMixer {
    let mix = AKMixer(input)
    zip(times, gains).forEach { (time, gain) -> () in
        let delay = AKDelay(input, time: time, feedback: 0.0, dryWetMix: 1)
        mix.connect(AKBooster(delay, gain: gain))
    }
    return mix
}

AudioKit.output = multitapDelay(player, times: [0.1, 0.2, 0.4], gains: [0.5, 2.0, 0.5])
AudioKit.start()
player.play()
