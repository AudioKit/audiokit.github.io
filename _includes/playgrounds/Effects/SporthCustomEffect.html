<p><h3>Sporth Custom Effect
</h3> If you need to make a custom sporth function (also called a ugen),
 you can pass instances of AKCustomUgen into AKOperationEffect&#39;s initializer,
 and access these functions in your sporth code using the <code>f</code> function.</p>

<p>In this example, we&#39;ve created a function <code>throttle</code>, that limits the distance
 that a float can move per second, which is useful for preventing a &quot;pop&quot;
 when parameters are changed, or just as a linear version of <code>port</code>.</p>

<p>Note that the function runs once for each sample, so you should make sure
 any custom ugen functions you create run as quickly as possible, so the audio
 stays smooth. This is why throttleUgen is defined in a separate file: if the
 playground tries to log every iteration in the sidebar, it slows the function
 down too much to work properly.</p>
