<p><h3>Tracking Amplitude
</h3> Determing the amplitude of an audio signal by
 outputting the value of a generator node into the AKAmplitudeTracker.
 This node is great if you want to build an app that does audio monitoring and analysis.</p>

{% highlight ruby %}import AudioKitPlaygrounds
import AudioKit

<p>First lets set up sound source to track</p>

{% highlight ruby %}let oscillatorNode = AKOperationGenerator { _ in
    // Let's set up the volume to be changing in the shape of a sine wave
    let volume = AKOperation.sineWave(frequency: 0.2).scale(minimum: 0, maximum: 0.5)

    // And lets make the frequency move around to make sure it doesn't affect the amplitude tracking
    let frequency = AKOperation.jitter(amplitude: 200, minimumFrequency: 10, maximumFrequency: 30) + 200

    // So our oscillator will move around randomly in frequency and have a smoothly varying amplitude
    return AKOperation.sineWave(frequency: frequency, amplitude: volume)
}

let trackedAmplitude = AKAmplitudeTracker(oscillatorNode)
AudioKit.output = trackedAmplitude
try AudioKit.start()
oscillatorNode.start()

<p>User Interface</p>

{% highlight ruby %}import AudioKitUI

class LiveView: AKLiveViewController {

    var trackedAmplitudeSlider: AKSlider?

    override func viewDidLoad() {

        AKPlaygroundLoop(every: 0.1) {
            self.trackedAmplitudeSlider?.value = trackedAmplitude.amplitude
        }

        addTitle("Tracking Amplitude")

        trackedAmplitudeSlider = AKSlider(property: "Tracked Amplitude", range: 0 ... 0.55) { _ in
            // Do nothing, just for display
        }
        addView(trackedAmplitudeSlider)

        addView(AKRollingOutputPlot.createView())
    }
}

<p>This keeps the playground running so that audio can play for a long time</p>

{% highlight ruby %}PlaygroundPage.current.needsIndefiniteExecution = true

{% endhighlight %}
<p>Experiment with this playground by changing the volume function to a
 phasor or another well-known function to see how well the amplitude tracker
 can track.  Also, you could change the sound source from an oscillator to a
 noise generator, or any constant sound source (some things like a physical
 model would not work because the output has an envelope to its volume).
 Instead of just plotting our results, we could use the value to drive other
 sounds or update an app&#39;s user interface.</p>
