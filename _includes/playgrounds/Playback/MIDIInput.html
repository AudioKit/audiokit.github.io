<p><h3>MIDI Input
</h3> This playground is kind of a basic MIDI Monitor. Make sure you&#39;ve got the console view open,
 and then start pounding on the MIDI devices you have hooked up to your computer and you should see output.</p>

{% highlight ruby %}import AudioKitPlaygrounds
import AudioKit

let midi = AudioKit.midi

{% endhighlight %}
<p>The input names list all of the MIDI devices currently hooked up</p>

{% highlight ruby %}midi.inputNames
{% endhighlight %}
<p>By opening up MIDI Input without specifying a particular port, we open up all ports.</p>

{% highlight ruby %}midi.openInput()

{% endhighlight %}
<p>By defining a class that is a MIDI Listener, but with no functions overridden,
 we just get the default behavior which is to print to the console.</p>

{% highlight ruby %}class PlaygroundMIDIReceiver: AKMIDIListener {
}

let receiver = PlaygroundMIDIReceiver()

{% endhighlight %}
<p>Add the new class to the list of MIDI listeners</p>

{% highlight ruby %}midi.addListener(receiver)

import PlaygroundSupport
PlaygroundPage.current.needsIndefiniteExecution = true
