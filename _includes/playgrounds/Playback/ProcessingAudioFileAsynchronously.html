<p><h3>Processing Audio File Asynchronously
</h3><h4>Processing some audio files in background
</h4></p>

{% highlight ruby %}import XCPlayground
import AudioKit

{% endhighlight %}
<p>We begin by cleaning our bedroom... (any audioFiles in the Temp directory are deleted)</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
AKAudioFile.cleanTempDirectory()

{% endhighlight %}
<p>We load the piano piece from resources and play it :</p>

{% highlight ruby %}var piano = try? AKAudioFile(readFileName: "poney.mp3")
let player = piano?.player
player?.looping = true

AudioKit.output = player!
AudioKit.start()
player!.start()
{% endhighlight %}
<p>While the piano is playing, we will process the file in background. AKAudioFile has a private ProcessFactory that will handle any process in background
 We define a call back that will be invoked when an async process has been completed. Notice that the process can have succeeded or failed. if processedFile is different from nil, process succeeded, so you can get the processed file. If processedFile is nil, process failed, but you can get the process thrown error :</p>

{% highlight ruby %}func callBack(processedFile: AKAudioFile?, error: NSError?) {

    // Each time our process is triggered, it will display some info about AKAudioFile Process Factory status :
    print("callBack Async process completed !")
    print("callBack -> How many async process have been scheduled: \(AKAudioFile.scheduledAsyncProcessesCount)")
    print("callBack -> How many uncompleted processes remain in the queue: \(AKAudioFile.queuedAsyncProcessCount)")
    print("callBack -> How many async process have been completed: \(AKAudioFile.completedAsyncProcessesCount)")

    // Now we handle the file (and the error if any occured.)
    if processedFile != nil {
        // We print its duration:
        print("callBack -> processed: \(processedFile!.duration)")
        // We replace the actual played file with the processed file
        try? player?.replaceFile(processedFile!)
        print("callBack -> Replaced player's file !")
    } else {
        print("callBack -> error: \(error)")
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}
<p>Let&#39;s process our piano asynchronously. First, we reverse the piano so it will play backward...</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
piano?.reverseAsynchronously(completionHandler: callBack)

print("How many async process have been scheduled: \(AKAudioFile.scheduledAsyncProcessesCount)")
print("How many uncompleted processes remain in the queue: \(AKAudioFile.queuedAsyncProcessCount)")
print("How many async process have been completed: \(AKAudioFile.completedAsyncProcessesCount)")

{% endhighlight %}
<p>Now we lower the piano level by normalizing it to a max level set at - 6 dB</p>

{% highlight ruby %}piano?.normalizeAsynchronously(newMaxLevel: 0, completionHandler: callBack)

print("How many async process have been scheduled: \(AKAudioFile.scheduledAsyncProcessesCount)")
print("How many uncompleted processes remain in the queue: \(AKAudioFile.queuedAsyncProcessCount)")
print("How many async process have been completed: \(AKAudioFile.completedAsyncProcessesCount)")



{% endhighlight %}
<p>Now, extract one second from piano...</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
piano?.extractAsynchronously(fromSample: 100000, toSample: 144100, completionHandler: callBack)

print("How many async process have been scheduled: \(AKAudioFile.scheduledAsyncProcessesCount)")
print("How many uncompleted processes remain in the queue: \(AKAudioFile.queuedAsyncProcessCount)")
print("How many async process have been completed: \(AKAudioFile.completedAsyncProcessesCount)")



{% endhighlight %}
<p>You may have noticed that Async Processes are queued serially. That means that the next process will only occur AFTER previous processes have been completed. First in, first out, completionHandlers will always be triggered in the same order as you invoked an async process.</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Most of the time, you &#39;ll want to chain process. Then, you have to define a specific callback for each process step. Let&#39;s experiment with the drum loop</p>

{% highlight ruby %}

var drumloop = try?  AKAudioFile(readFileName: "drumloop.wav")

{% endhighlight %}
<p>We will first reverse the loop, and append the original loop to the reversed loop, and replace the file of our player with the resulting processed file.</p>

{% highlight ruby %}drumloop?.reverseAsynchronously() { reversedFile, error in
    if reversedFile != nil {
        print("Drum Loop has been reversed")
        reversedFile!.appendAsynchronously(file: drumloop!) { appendedFile, error in
            if appendedFile != nil {
                print("Original drum loop has been appended to the reversed loop, so we can play the resulting file.")
                try? player?.replaceFile(appendedFile!)
            } else {
                print("error: \(error)")
            }
        }
    } else {
        print("error: \(error)")
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}
<p>These processes are done in background, that means that the next line will be printed BEFORE the first (or any) async process has ended.</p>

{% highlight ruby %}print("Can refresh UI or do anything while processing...")
