<p><h3>Connecting Nodes
</h3><h4>Playing audio is great, but now let&#39;s process that audio. Now that you&#39;re up and running, let&#39;s take it a step further by loading up an audio file and processing it. We&#39;re going to do this by connecting nodes together. A node is simply an object that will take in audio input, process it, and pass the processed audio to another node, or to the Digital-Analog Converter (speaker).

{% highlight ruby %}import XCPlayground
import AudioKit

let bundle = NSBundle.mainBundle()
let file = bundle.pathForResource("drumloop", ofType: "wav")

{% endhighlight %}
<p>Here we set up a player to the loop the file&#39;s playback</p>

{% highlight ruby %}var player = AKAudioPlayer(file!)
player.looping = true

{% endhighlight %}
<p>Next we&#39;ll connect the audio player to a delay effect</p>

{% highlight ruby %}var delay = AKDelay(player)

{% endhighlight %}
<p>Set the parameters of the delay here</p>

{% highlight ruby %}delay.time = 0.1 // seconds
delay.feedback  = 0.8 // Normalized Value 0 - 1
delay.dryWetMix = 0.2 // Normalized Value 0 - 1

{% endhighlight %}
<p>You can continue add more nodes as you wish, and here we add a reverb</p>

{% highlight ruby %}let reverb = AKReverb(delay)
reverb.loadFactoryPreset(.Cathedral)

AudioKit.output = reverb
AudioKit.start()

player.play()

XCPlaygroundPage.currentPage.needsIndefiniteExecution = true
