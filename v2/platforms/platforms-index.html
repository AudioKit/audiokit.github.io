<p>AudioKit works on iOS mobile devices and OSX computers.  It is written in Objective-C but you can easily use it from a Swift-based app or application as well.</p>

<h3>Audio Engine</h3>

<p>
AudioKit relies on a world-class core audio engine called <a href="http://csound.github.io/">Csound</a>.  We chose Csound for a variety of reasons which we outline below.
</p>

<tr>
  <td><b>High Performance</b></td>
  <td>Core code is written in the C language and optimized for efficiency and speed.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><b>Huge Library of Opcodes</b></td>
  <td>Csound has a library of opcodes that covers practically every facet of audio synthesis, effects, and analysis.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><b>Open-Source</b></td>
  <td>Csound is completely open-sourced and always will be.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><b>Cross-Platform</b></td>
  <td>Runs on Mac, Linux, and Windows as well as on iOS and Android devices.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><b>Continuously Developed</b></td>
  <td>Csound is highly evolved, thanks to an excellent core team of developers dedicated to improving and modernizing the code.</td>

<p>What AudioKit provides on top of all this is a simple, human-readable interface to Csound's functionality within the familiar programming environment of Xcode and developing in Objective-C or Swift with integrated documentation and code-completion.  You can easily tie your app's logic to sound or music parameters for instance.  Additionally, you can use all of the modern features of these languages to govern audio events and sequences.</p>
