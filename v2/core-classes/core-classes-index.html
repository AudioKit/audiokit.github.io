<h3>Foundation</h3>

<p>The header file "AKFoundation.h" is what you have to import to use AudioKit.  It includes all of AudioKit's core classes os well as all operations, instruments, and note classes.  In addition, it includes all of the utlity classes of instruments, plots, and user interface elements.</p>

<h3>Manager</h3>

<p>This class handles all of the lower-level interaction with the audio engine.   It rarely needs to be referred to expect for advanced users.</p>

<h3>Orchestra</h3>

<p>The orchestra is the object that you'll add your instruments to, makes sense doesn't it?  You can also tell the orchestra to start or stop or when you've updated an instrument it needs to reload.</p>

<h3>MIDI</h3>

<p>AudioKit's MIDI functionality is stored here but could eventually be moved into "Utilities" since we certainly don't all need to use MIDI.</p>
